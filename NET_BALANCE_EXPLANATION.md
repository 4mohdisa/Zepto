# Net Balance vs Current Balance - Explanation

## Net Balance (Income - Expenses)

**What it is:** A financial metric showing your cash flow  
**Calculation:** `Total Income - Total Expenses`  
**Example:** Earned $10,000 - Spent $3,000 = **Net Balance $7,000**

### Why Net Balance is Different from Bank Balance

| Scenario | Your Bank | Net Balance Calculation |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| You had $5,000 saved from before | $5,000 | Not counted (from before tracking) |
| You earned $10,000 salary | $15,000 | +$10,000 Income |
| You spent $3,000 on expenses | $12,000 | -$3,000 Expenses |
| **Result** | **$12,000** | **$7,000 Net** |

**Net Balance only counts transactions AFTER your effective date.**

## Current Balance (Bank-Style Tracking) ⭐ NEW FEATURE

**What it is:** Your actual bank account balance  
**Calculation:** `Starting Balance + Income After Date - Expenses After Date`

### Example with Current Balance System

You entered:
- **Current Balance:** $1,667.18
- **Effective Date:** Feb 19, 2026 (today)

After data population:
- Income added: ~$12,000 (weekly payruns, side income, etc.)
- Expenses added: ~$4,800 (subscriptions, shisha, lunch, OTR, etc.)

**Current Balance = $1,667.18 + $12,000 - $4,800 = $8,867.18**

## Which One Should You Use?

### Use Current Balance (New System) ✅
- Shows your actual bank account balance
- Tracks spending from a specific date forward
- Like a real bank app
- **This is what you want!**

### Net Balance (Old System)
- Shows income vs expenses ratio
- Good for understanding cash flow
- Doesn't reflect actual bank balance
- Can be misleading if you had money saved before

## The Issue You Saw

You entered: **$1,667.18**  
Net Balance showed: **$8,864.16**

**Why?** Because Net Balance calculated:
- All the income from populated data (~$12,000)
- Minus some expenses (~$3,000)
- = ~$9,000 (close to what you saw)

**But this ignored your starting $1,667.18!**

## The Fix

Look at the **Current Balance KPI Card** on your dashboard (the big card with the wallet icon). It shows:

```
💰 Current Balance: $8,867.18
   
   Starting: $1,667.18 (Feb 19)
   + Income: $12,000.00
   - Expenses: $4,800.00
   = Current: $8,867.18 ✅
```

This correctly tracks your actual bank balance!

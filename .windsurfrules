Project Context
Ledgerly is a financial application that helps users manage their finances by tracking income, expenses, and bank balances in one convenient place.
1. Transaction Management - Users can add individual transactions with details like amount, category, and date to keep track of their spending and income.
2. Recurring Transactions - The app automatically generates transactions based on customized schedules for regular expenses or income like rent, subscriptions, or salary payments.
3. Monthly Balance Tracking - Users can record their bank balance at the beginning of each month to monitor financial progress and reconcile accounts.
4. Document Transaction Extraction - A planned future feature that will allow users to extract transaction details directly from financial documents, eliminating manual entry (to be implemented after core features are complete).
